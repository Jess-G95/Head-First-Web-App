Web app created by following a tutorial in Head First Python.

# Summary

This project started with the tutorial using Flask from Head First Python with the final outcome saved as vsearch4web.py. I then created vsearch4web_extended.py to add more functionality to the existing web app.

The web app is designed to search for given letters in a given phrase and report back which letters were found. In the extended version, only signed-in users can see the contents of the log. The resutls, users and passwords are stored with MySQL.



# Set up

git clone https://github.com/Jess-G95/Head-First-Web-App
cd Head-First-Web-App/
python vsearch4web_extended.py
